## History

Golf Solitaire emerged in the **mid-20th century** from the family of “adding or stepping” patience games.  
Its name references the **score-like feel** (fewer cards left is better) and the brisk, hole-by-hole pacing found in early printed rulebooks and later **PC/mobile solitaire collections**.  
Digital versions popularized short rounds, streak bonuses, and optional wrap-around rules.

## Rules of Golf Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective
**Clear the tableau** by moving cards onto the waste pile in **ascending or descending steps of exactly one rank** (e.g., 7 → 6 or 7 → 8).  
You typically **win** by clearing all tableau cards before the stock runs out.

---

### 🎴 Setup
- Use **one 52-card deck**.
- Deal **7 columns of 5 cards each** (35 total) **face up** to form the **tableau**.  
  Only the **top card** of each column is available for play.
- Place the **remaining 17 cards** face down as the **stock**.
- Flip the top stock card face up to start the **waste pile**.

---

### 🔁 Gameplay
1. **Step by one rank (any suit).**  
   You may move a tableau card to the waste pile if it is **exactly one rank higher or lower** than the waste’s top card.  
   - Example sequences: 10 → 9 → 10 → J → 10 → 9 …  
   - **Classic rule:** **No wrap** between **Ace** and **King** (Aces are low).  
     *(Some variants allow K↔A “wrap”; see Variations.)*

2. **Reveal new top cards.**  
   After moving a card off a column, the next card in that column becomes available.

3. **No tableau building.**  
   You never stack tableau cards on each other - only onto the waste pile.

4. **Draw when stuck.**  
   If no tableau card can move to the waste, **draw** the next stock card onto the waste and continue.

5. **Round end.**  
   The round ends when either the **tableau is cleared** (win) or the **stock is exhausted** and no moves remain.

## Scoring (Common Systems)
Scoring varies by app/site, but popular approaches include:
- **Cards-remaining score:** Your score equals the **number of tableau cards left** (lower is better; **0** is a perfect round).  
- **Points for moves/streaks:** Positive points per moved card, with **combo bonuses** for long runs without drawing from stock.  
- **Time/bonus modes:** Extra points for clearing quickly or clearing multiple boards in a streak.

---

## 🧠 Strategy Tips for Golf Solitaire
- **Favor longer runs.** When two moves are available, **choose the branch** that keeps multiple future steps alive.  
- **Watch duplicates.** If the waste shows a value with **few remaining neighbors** (e.g., many 7s already used), consider drawing early.  
- **Open columns.** Clearing a column increases flexibility by exposing “fresh” ranks sooner.  
- **Delay drawing when possible.** Each stock draw can break momentum; squeeze extra tableau moves before you draw.  
- **Plan for endgame ranks.** Try not to leave many **Aces** or **Kings** late if wrap is **off**; they each have only one neighbor.

---

## Variations
- **Wrap-Around Golf:** Allows **K↔A** adjacency. Increases run potential and difficulty management.  
- **Relaxed Golf (Oasis/Classic+):** Permits moving **any** tableau card to an **empty waste** at the start (or adds a wildcard/Joker in some apps).  
- **Vegas/Points Mode:** Adds chips/points, combo streaks, and multiple “holes” (boards) per round.  
- **Draw-3/Draw-x:** Changes stock reveal cadence; useful for tougher, puzzle-like play.
