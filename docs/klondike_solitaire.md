## History

Klondike Solitaire is believed to have originated in the **Klondike region of Canada** during the late **19th-century gold rush**.  
Miners are said to have played the game in remote camps to pass time, giving the game its enduring name.

The game became globally famous when **Microsoft** included it as *“Solitaire”* in **Windows 3.0 (1990)**.  
It was designed by **Wes Cherry**, a Microsoft intern, to help users learn how to use the mouse through drag-and-drop mechanics.

Since then, Klondike has become a household name, inspiring countless versions for **mobile, desktop, and web**, and remains one of the most played card games in digital history.

## Rules of Klondike Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective
Move all cards to the **foundation piles**, sorted by suit and in ascending order:  
**Ace → 2 → 3 → … → King**

---

### 🎴 Setup
- Klondike uses **one standard 52-card deck**.
- The cards are dealt into **seven tableau columns**:
  - The first column gets **1 card**, the second **2 cards**, and so on up to **7 cards**.
  - Only the **top card** in each column is face up.
- The remaining cards form the **stock pile**, which is used to draw new cards during play.

---

### 🔁 Gameplay
1. **Build Tableau Columns:**  
   Cards in the tableau are built in descending order and **alternating colors** (e.g., red 7 on black 8).
2. **Move Cards:**  
   You can move a single card or an entire descending sequence of alternating colors.
3. **Empty Columns:**  
   Only a **King (or a sequence starting with a King)** can be placed into an empty tableau column.
4. **Draw from Stock:**  
   Draw cards from the stock pile - typically one at a time (*“Draw 1”*) or three at a time (*“Draw 3”*), depending on the rules you choose.
5. **Move to Foundations:**  
   Build each foundation pile by suit from **Ace to King**.

---

### 🧠 Game Modes
- **Draw 1:** Easier mode - cards are drawn one at a time from the stock pile.
- **Draw 3:** More challenging - cards are drawn three at a time, making strategy more important.

---

### 🏆 Winning the Game
You win when all four suits are successfully built in the foundation piles from **Ace through King**.  
Your score or performance may depend on **time, number of moves,** or **draw type (1-card vs 3-card)**.

---

## Strategy Tips
- **Flip face-down cards early.** Prioritize moves that reveal hidden cards in the tableau.
- **Expose Aces and low cards.** Move Aces to foundations as soon as possible.
- **Keep Kings ready.** Only free a column when you have a King to place there.
- **Don’t rush to the foundation.** Sometimes leaving cards in the tableau allows more flexible moves later.
- **Use undo strategically.** Many digital versions allow undo to correct hasty moves.

---

## Variations
- **Klondike by Threes:** Draw three cards from the stock at a time.
- **Double Klondike (Two Decks):** Uses two decks for longer, more complex play.
- **Easthaven:** A faster-paced variant with shorter piles and immediate redeals.
