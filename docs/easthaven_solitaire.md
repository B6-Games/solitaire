   - You can move a single card or a sequence of properly ordered cards.

2. **Empty Columns**  
   - Only a **King (or a sequence starting with a King)** can be moved into an empty tableau column.

3. **Deal Cards from the Stock**  
   - When no more moves are available, deal one card from the stock onto **each tableau column** simultaneously.  
   - This mechanic makes Easthaven more dynamic than Klondike.

5. **Winning the Game**  
   - You win when all cards are successfully built into the four foundation piles.

## 🧠 Strategy Tips for Easthaven Solitaire

- **Expose hidden cards early.** Always focus on uncovering buried cards in the tableau first.  
- **Prioritize empty columns.** Empty spaces are critical for rearranging long sequences.  
- **Think before dealing.** Since stock cards go directly onto the tableau, plan ahead to avoid blocking moves.  
- **Move Aces and low cards quickly.** These free up space and create chain reactions.  
- **Alternate colors carefully.** Proper color alternation ensures longer move sequences later.

---

## Variations

- **Easthaven Two Decks:** Uses 104 cards for a longer and more complex challenge.  
- **Draw Three Easthaven:** Deals three cards at a time from the stock (like Klondike by Threes).  
- **Relaxed Easthaven:** Allows building regardless of suit or color, ideal for beginners.

## Fun Fact 💡

Because Easthaven deals new cards directly into the tableau, many players call it the **“action version” of Klondike** - every move matters, and new opportunities appear with each deal.
