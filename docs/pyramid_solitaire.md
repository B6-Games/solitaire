## Rules of Pyramid Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective

Remove all the cards from the **pyramid** by pairing cards that **add up to 13** in value.

---

### 🎴 Card Values

- **King (K)** = 13 (can be removed alone)  
- **Queen (Q)** = 12  
- **Jack (J)** = 11  
- **10** = 10, **9** = 9, ... **Ace (A)** = 1

---

### 🧱 Setup

- Use **one standard 52-card deck**.  
- Deal **28 cards** into a pyramid layout:  
  - 1 card in the first row  
  - 2 in the second  
  - 3 in the third  
  - ... up to **7 cards** in the bottom row  
- The remaining **24 cards** form the **stock pile**, placed face down.

Only **uncovered cards** (not blocked by others) are available for play.

---

### 🔁 Gameplay

1. **Pair Cards That Add to 13**  
   - Remove pairs of uncovered cards that total 13 (e.g., 8 + 5, 10 + 3, etc.).  
   - Kings are worth 13 and can be removed on their own.

2. **Use the Stock Pile**  
   - Draw cards one at a time from the stock pile to pair with uncovered pyramid cards.

3. **Waste Pile**  
   - If a stock card can’t be paired immediately, it moves to the **waste pile**.  
   - Only the top card of the waste pile is playable.

4. **Continue Until the Pyramid Is Cleared**  
   - The game is won when all cards in the pyramid are removed.

### 🏆 Winning the Game

You win when **all pyramid cards** have been successfully paired and removed.  
If no moves remain and cards are left in the pyramid, the game is lost.

Many digital versions allow **redeals** or **extra stock passes** to make the game more forgiving.

---

## Strategy Tips

- **Focus on freeing blocked cards.** Removing cards near the top of the pyramid early opens more moves.  
- **Plan ahead.** Check which cards are available before removing pairs.  
- **Save Kings wisely.** Remove them only when they don’t block useful cards.  
- **Use stock carefully.** Avoid wasting valuable pairing cards from the deck too early.  
- **Think in layers.** Each move can unlock multiple future options - prioritize flexibility.

---

## Variations

- **Easy Pyramid:** Allows unlimited redeals or smaller pyramid sizes.  
- **Relaxed Pyramid:** Allows pairing between the waste pile and stock pile.  
- **TriPeaks (Three Peaks):** A popular modern variation featuring three overlapping pyramids and faster-paced play.

## Fun Fact 💡

In many versions of Microsoft’s Pyramid Solitaire, the game tracks your **clearing streak** - rewarding players who can clear multiple pyramids in a row without losing.
