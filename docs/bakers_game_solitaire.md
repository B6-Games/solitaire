# 🧱 Baker’s Game Solitaire: Rules, History, and How to Play Online

## Overview

**Baker’s Game Solitaire** is the suit-pure ancestor of **FreeCell**.  
Played with **one standard 52-card deck**, it looks like FreeCell at a glance-same four **FreeCells** and eight tableau columns-but it’s tougher because tableau stacks must build **down by suit** (not alternating colors).  
Your objective is to move all cards to the **four foundation piles**, **Ace → King** by suit.

## History

Most sources attribute Baker’s Game to **C. L. Baker** in the **early 20th century**.  
It later inspired **FreeCell**, which relaxed the building rule to alternating colors.  
As solitaire collections moved to PC and mobile, Baker’s Game found a niche with players who enjoy **more deterministic, logic-heavy** gameplay.

## Rules of Baker’s Game Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective
Build all four **foundations** from **Ace to King** in the same suit.

---

### 🎴 Setup
- **Deck:** One 52-card deck.  
- **Tableau:** **8 columns**, all **face up** at deal:
  - First **4 columns** with **7 cards** each  
  - Last **4 columns** with **6 cards** each  
- **FreeCells:** **4 open cells**, each holds one card.  
- **Foundations:** Start empty (Aces go first).

> Snapshot: 8 columns, 4 FreeCells, build **down by suit** on the tableau, **up by suit** to foundations.

---

### 🔁 Gameplay

1. **Tableau Building (Down by Suit)**  
   - Place a card on a card **one rank higher of the same suit** (e.g., ♠8 on ♠9).  
   - You may move **single cards** or **in-suit descending sequences** if you have space to simulate moving them one at a time (see Mobility).

2. **FreeCells (Temporary Holds)**  
   - Each cell holds **one card**.  
   - Use them as staging areas to reorganize and free key cards.

3. **Empty Columns**  
   - **Any card or in-suit sequence** may be moved to an empty tableau column.  
   - (This is a key difference from games like Eight Off, which often require Kings.)

4. **Foundations (Up by Suit)**  
   - Move **Aces** to foundations when free, then build **A → 2 → … → K** in suit.

### ♻️ Mobility (How Many Cards Can Move Together?)

In most apps, moving a multi-card in-suit sequence is allowed if you have enough temporary space (empty cells/columns) to **simulate** moving the stack one card at a time.

A practical rule of thumb:
Max movable cards ≈ (number of empty FreeCells + 1) × (number of empty columns + 1)
If a long drag isn’t permitted, break the move into smaller steps using FreeCells and empties.

### 🏆 Winning the Game
You win when all cards are in the foundations **Ace → King** by suit.  
With every card face up, outcomes hinge on **planning, timing,** and **space management**-not luck.

## 🧠 Strategy Tips for Baker’s Game

- **Keep suits pure.** Avoid mixing suits in partial stacks; only pure in-suit runs move as units.  
- **Protect empty space.** FreeCells and empty columns are your **mobility engine**-use them, then reopen them quickly.  
- **Surface Aces and low cards early.** Early foundation progress creates more legal placements.  
- **Stage before stacking.** Park blockers in cells, assemble longer in-suit runs elsewhere, then collapse efficiently.  
- **Plan King placements.** An early empty column makes it easier to maneuver high-rank cards and complete suit runs.

---

## Variations & Close Relatives

- **FreeCell:** Same layout but **build down by alternating colors**; more flexible and generally easier.  
- **Eight Off:** 8 reserve cells with some pre-filled; **Kings-only** to empties in many rulesets; also **down by suit**.  
- **Seahaven Towers:** 10 columns, 4 cells; typically **Kings-only** to empties-tight and tactical.
