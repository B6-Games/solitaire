## History

The origins of Spider Solitaire date back to the **early 20th century**, though the exact inventor is unknown. The name "Spider" likely comes from the fact that the game requires building **eight completed sequences** — similar to a spider having eight legs.

Spider Solitaire became globally recognized when **Microsoft** introduced it as part of its Windows operating system in **1998**. The game’s addictive nature and built-in score tracking made it a casual classic among office workers and home users alike.

Today, Spider Solitaire remains one of the most-played digital card games, available across **mobile, web, and desktop platforms** — often with multiple difficulty levels such as *1 Suit*, *2 Suits*, and *4 Suits*.

## Rules of Spider Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective
The goal is to arrange all the cards in descending sequences from **King to Ace** of the same suit within the tableau. Once a complete sequence is formed, it is automatically removed from the tableau. The game is won when all eight sequences are completed.

---

### 🎴 Setup
- Played with **two standard 52-card decks (104 cards)**.
- **Ten tableau columns** are dealt:
  - The first four columns have **6 cards** each.
  - The remaining six columns have **5 cards** each.
  - Only the **top card** in each column is face up.
- The remaining 50 cards form the **stock pile** (to deal more cards later).

---

### 🔁 Gameplay
1. **Move Cards:** You can move cards in descending order (King → Queen → Jack → ... → Ace), regardless of suit.
2. **Build Sequences:** To move a sequence of cards, all cards in that sequence must be of the **same suit**.
3. **Empty Columns:** Any card (or sequence starting with a King) can be placed into an empty column.
4. **Deal New Cards:** When no further moves are possible or you wish to continue, click the stock pile to deal one new card onto each tableau column.
   - You can only deal new cards when **no empty columns** exist.
5. **Remove Completed Sequences:** Once a full King-to-Ace sequence of the same suit is created, it is automatically removed.

### 🧠 Difficulty Levels
Spider Solitaire often comes in three main variations:
- **1 Suit (Easy):** All cards are of the same suit — good for beginners.
- **2 Suits (Medium):** Typically spades and hearts — adds more challenge.
- **4 Suits (Hard):** Uses all four suits — requires high-level strategy and planning.

---

### 🏆 Winning the Game
You win when all **eight full sequences (King → Ace)** are completed and removed from the tableau.  
The game can be scored based on moves, time, or number of undos used, depending on the platform.

---

## Strategy Tips
- **Expose hidden cards early.** Focus on uncovering face-down cards to open new possibilities.
- **Build in-suit sequences.** Mixing suits makes rearranging harder later.
- **Keep empty columns.** They’re vital for moving long sequences.
- **Delay dealing new cards.** Always exhaust current moves first to avoid locking cards.
